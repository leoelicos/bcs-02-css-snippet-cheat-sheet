## Description

This project was introduced in bootcamp as a demonstration of responsive design and flexbox. I wrote this app in HTML/CSS/Javascript based on the mockup to illustrate the convenience of flexbox. It solves the problem of responsive design efficiency and I learned about difficult concepts like flex value.
